# AVR-NES
This is a NES emulator for the EVK1105, running on an AVR32 microcontroller. To run you will need an SDCARD, some roms 
and some .pngs for the menu. I have tested only Super Mario Bros, Volleyball and other games.

**Warning** Runs *slow*, really *slow* 

More of a showcase than anything.

See it running super mario bros [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6mPG04RSgk)



Kudos to  Rupert Shuttleworth for the original NES emulator implementation.
